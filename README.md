        Simple Bank Account app with basic functionnalities (deposit, withdraw, operations history)

        Dynamic generated tests at runtime with Junit 5.

        Each previously listed functionnality is tested on a set of data, generating a test for each single value, and that is performed by the @TestFactory decorator added in Junit 5.
